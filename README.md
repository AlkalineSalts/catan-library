This project is one part of my continuing project ot build a version of catan accessible to everyone. I've found that current solutions are heavily centralized, and I want people to be able to play catan in the same way that people can play Minecraft, hosted from their own machines. This library represents the first part of this project; the next steps involve making a multiplayer server host (will probably use tomcat) and making a multiplayer client (desktop at first, but open to making web based client as well).
